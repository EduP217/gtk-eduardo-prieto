        Style Guide

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/ffffff-ffcad4-b0d0d3-c08497-f7af9d" target="_blank"><i><u>https://coolors.co/ffffff-ffcad4-b0d0d3-c08497-f7af9d</u></i></a></p>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#F7AF9D]</td><td class="secondary">[#C08497]</td><td class="accent1">[#B0D0D3]</td><td class="accent2">[#FFCAD4]</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: <u>Yaldevi</u> <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Choosing this font was a personal desire, I consider that it is according to the purpose of the business. In the same way, to promote the products that are sold in its stores, therefore we need letters that are adaptable to the size of the device and that are prominent.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: <u>ABeeZee</u> <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font is the best to share comments, display ideas, giving details, and offer to the user the best experience while reading long text, we need that it must be comfortable.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
