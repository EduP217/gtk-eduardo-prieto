              Hello, my friends, my name is <i>Eduardo Prieto</i> and I am so happy to introduce myself. 
              <br>
              I am actually living in Perú I was born in this wonderful country. 
              I am 27 years old I love to play sports and in my free time, I love to play videogames 
              or watch a movie. I have watched the MCU movies in one week I consider it as a personal goal. 
              A personal desire is to share my country's typical food to my friends prepared by me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am actually working in Avatar S.AC. as a backend developer. After coming back from my mission I have completed studies 
              in CIBERTEC it is a technological institute. I have found in programming great inspiration for my temporal and spiritual life.
              I love to build programs code and that this be an essencial part in the life of millions of users.

            <p>
              I have served a mission for 2 years in the <u>Perú Cusco Mission</u>. I have been in 4 regional departments of my country. 
              I have had 12 companion partners and I have serve the Lord every day after my baptism. I am currently
              waiting for my future wife and she's currently serving in the same mission I was.
              <br>
              I have a great testimony of the restauration, the prophets and revelation and the God's plan of salvation.
              I do believe that the Lord has an excellent plan for every one. I beg to keep serving in this salvation work.
